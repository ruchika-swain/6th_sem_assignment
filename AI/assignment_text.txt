Artificial intelligence (AI) makes it possible for machines to learn from experience, adjust to new inputs 
and perform human-like tasks. Most AI examples that you hear about today – from chess-playing computers to 
self-driving cars – rely heavily on deep learning and natural language processing. Using these technologies, 
computers can be trained to accomplish specific tasks by processing large amounts of data and recognizing 
patterns in the data.
